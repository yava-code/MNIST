# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition 🔢

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my MNIST project. This is basically my attempt at teaching a computer to read handwritten numbers. Pretty cool, right?

## What's This About?

So, MNIST is this famous dataset that has like thousands of images of handwritten digits (0-9). It's basically the "Hello World" of machine learning and computer vision. Everyone starts here when they're learning about neural networks!

## What I Did

I built a neural network that can look at a picture of a handwritten digit and tell you what number it is. It's trained on 60,000 images and can actually get pretty accurate! (Way better than my own handwriting recognition skills lol)

## Files in This Repo

- `main.ipynb` - The main Jupyter notebook where all the magic happens
- `index.html` - A simple webpage showing off this project (check it out on GitHub Pages!)

## How to Run This

1. First, you'll need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yava-code/MNIST.git`
3. Open up `main.ipynb` in Jupyter
4. Run the cells and watch the model train!

## Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (whatever I ended up using)
- Jupyter Notebook
- A bunch of coffee ☕

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about:
- How neural networks actually work (not just the theory!)
- Training and testing models
- Working with image data
- Debugging when things don't work the first time (or the second... or third...)

## Future Ideas

Maybe I'll add:
- A web interface where you can draw your own digit
- Better model architecture to get even higher accuracy
- Visualization of what the network "sees"
